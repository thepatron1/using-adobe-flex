# About the command-line compilers

You use the mxmlc and compc command-line compilers to compile your MXML and AS
files into SWF and SWC files. You can use the utilities to precompile
applications that you want to deploy on another server or to automate
compilation in a testing environment.

To use the command-line compilers, you must have a Java run-time environment in
your system path.

For Flex SDK, the command-line compilers are located in the
_flex_install_dir_/bin directory. For Flash Builder, the compilers are located
in the _flash_builder_install_dir_/sdks/_sdk_version_/bin directory.

When using mxmlc and compc on the command line, you can also use a configuration
file to store your options rather than list them on the command line. You can
store command-line options as XML blocks in a configuration file. For more
information, see
[About configuration files](../about-configuration-files/index.md).
