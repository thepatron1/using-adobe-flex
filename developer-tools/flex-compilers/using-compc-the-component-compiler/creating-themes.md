# Creating themes

You can use the `include-file` and `include-classes` options to add skin files
and style sheets to a SWC file. The SWC file can then be used as a theme. For
more information about using themes in applications, see
[Styles and themes](../../../enhancing-the-user-interface/styles-and-themes.md).
