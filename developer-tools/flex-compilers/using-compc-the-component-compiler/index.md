# Using compc, the component compiler

You use the component compiler to generate a SWC file from component source
files and other asset files such as images and style sheets.

To use the component compiler with Flex SDK, you use the compc command-line
utility. In Flash Builder, you use the compc component compiler by building a
new Flex Library Project. Some of the Flex SDK command-line options have
equivalents in the Flash Builder environment. You use the tabs in the Flex
Library Build Path dialog box to add classes, libraries, and other resources to
the SWC file.
