# Using mxmlc, the application compiler

You use the application compiler to compile SWF files from your ActionScript and
MXML source files.

The application compiler's options let you define settings such as the library
path and whether to include debug information in the resulting SWF file. Also,
you can set application-specific settings such as the frame rate at which the
SWF file should play and its height and width.

To invoke the application compiler with Flex SDK, you use the mxmlc command-line
utility. In Flash Builder, you use the application compiler by building a new
Flex Project. Some of the Flex SDK command-line options have equivalents in the
Flash Builder environment. For example, you can use the tabs in the Flex Build
Path dialog box to add classes and libraries to your project.

The following set of examples use the application compiler.
